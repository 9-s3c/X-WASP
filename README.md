# X-WASP

Twitter/X OAuth Hacking Tool

This program is intended solely for educational purposes. The developer is not responsible for any misuse of this tool.

X-WASP is a hacking tool designed to control Twitter user accounts through OAuth tokens and the Twitter API. It operates without requiring the user to input a username, password, or two-factor authentication (2FA), provided that the user accesses it via the Twitter app or website. Once X-WASP retrieves a Twitter user's tokens through the API authorization page, it can create and delete tweets on the user's account using the X-WASP panel.
